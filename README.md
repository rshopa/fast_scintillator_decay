# Decay kinetics in fast scintillators

This is an attempt to evaluate the decay kinetic constant of the luminescence of BaF<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles upon high-energy X-ray excitation.

In measurements of time properties of luminescence, a rapid impulse of X-ray radiation is being generated to irradiate the scintillator, which emits light. The time dependence of its intensity is being measured as the output signal. Since the duration of emitted luminescence is relatively long, while the excitation impulse is negligible, nearly delta-like signal, the output might be considered as a 'pure' decay kinetics of the scintillator.

In case of fast scintillators like BaF<sub>2</sub>, luminescence decay is quick, of the same scale as the excitation impulse. Therefore, the output signal is composed of both decay and impulse. In order to exclude excitation one has to evaluate convolution equation y(t) = f(t) ∗ g(t), where '∗'-sign means convolution, y(t) - is the output (measured) signal, g(t) - excitation impulse, f(t) - unknown function of luminescence decay kinetics.

>The simplest model, describing luminescence decay kinetics (time dependence of intensity) in 'classical' scintillator, is exponential f(t) = I<sub>0</sub> exp<sup>(-t/t<sub>0</sub>)</sup>. By using nonlinear fitting (regression) or Fourier transformation tools, we calculate the 'true' decay kinetics f(t).
